# PubMed Scrape

Simple automation project on retrieving all PubMed article titles, abstracts, and links to full article from first 10 PubMed search results.

When looking for the right articles during research, researchers have to go back and forth to read the abstract,
find the relevant articles, copy and save its link(s) to full text.

The python script takes in user input for search keywords, then stores the first 10 article titles, abstracts, and link(s) to full article in a txt file named after the search.
